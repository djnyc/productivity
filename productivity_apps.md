# productivity
Here are a few killer apps and ideas that I have found in my obsessive productivity research
## Windows

## Linux
- _emacs_ is obviously one of _the_ text editors and inevitably has a mode for all occasions. There is even an [emacs todo.txt mode].
- don't forget what you can do using [github] itself. Obviously _Linux_ itself was written by Linus Torvalds using _git_ so unsurprisingly there is a lot that you can do here.

## MacOS

## iOS
- [slack]
- [ToDo.txt]
- [Wunderlist]
- [editorial]
- [Notesy]
- [Drafts]


> todo: These need linking properly

## Web
- [slack]
- [github]
- [draftin]


## Multi-platform
- [atom] is GitHub's editor and thus it is very good at a lot of stuff. It has a lot of packages, including a **todo.txt package**.
