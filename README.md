# productivity
Here are a few killer apps and ideas that I have found in my obsessive productivity research
## Windows

## Linux
- _emacs_ is obviously one of _the_ text editors and inevitably has a mode for all occasions. There is even an [emacs todo.txt mode].
- don't forget what you can do using [github] itself. Obviously _Linux_ itself was written by Linus Torvalds using _git_ so unsurprisingly there is a lot that you can do here.
## MacOS

## iOS
- slack
- todo.txt
- wunderlist
- editorial
- notesy
[//]: # These need linking properly

## Web
- slack
- [github]
- 

## Multi-platform
